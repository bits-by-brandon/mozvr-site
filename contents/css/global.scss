Structure:

1. Base: base element styles
2. Utility: simple typographic and layout utilities
3. Layout: flexible, responsive, and reusable layout modules
4. Theme: simple, customizable color utilities

Am using object oriented CSS pattern.
Per http://www.basscss.com/docs/guides/basics/, principles are:

- Keep styles as reusable as possible.
- Only apply styles to base elements once.
- Never use ids, attributes (e.g. [type=text]) or the universal selector (*) as selectors.
- Never use adjoining selectors.
- Avoid parent and sibling selectors.
- Prefer using class selectors directly on the elements they’re styling.
- Use clear, descriptive names for selectors.
- Keep structural styles and theme styles separate.
- Avoid using mixins and extends in sass – it’s often easier and more readable (especially for others) to write styles out by hand.

Declare classes on elements in following order:

1. Typography
2. Positioning
3. Layout
4. Color & Theme
5. State
