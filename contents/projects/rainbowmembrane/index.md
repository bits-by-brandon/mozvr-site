intro: A motion-controlled VR sensory experience with Leap Motion and WebGL.
---

<p class="intro h2">"Rainbow Membrane" is a virtual reality sensory experience that uses the [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/) motion controller and the [LeapJS JavaScript API](https://developer.leapmotion.com/gallery/tags/javascript) to generate a shifting rainbow world that responds to touch. Stepping inside an iridescent cube, users can warp the fabric of reality and sound by moving their hands in space. The effect is surreal, beautiful, and oddly addictive.</p>
