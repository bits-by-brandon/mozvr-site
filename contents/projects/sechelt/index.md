<p class="intro h2">"Sechelt" is a virtual reality visualization of an inlet near the town of [Sechelt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sechelt_Inlet), on British Columbia's southern coast, rendered in gradients and colors inspired by the work of renowned Canadian painter [Roy Henry Vickers](http://www.royhenryvickers.com/). It was designed and built by Josh Carpenter of Mozilla in collaboration with [Mr.DOOB](http://twitter.com/mrdoob) of Three.js. Cinema4D was used to first design the look and feel of the world, and then models, textures and camera paths were imported into a Three.js scene programmed by DOOB.</p>
