<p class="intro h2">"Sechelt" is a virtual reality visualization of an inlet near the town of [Sechelt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sechelt_Inlet), on British Columbia's southern coast, rendered in gradients and colors inspired by the work of renowned Canadian painter [Roy Henry Vickers](http://www.royhenryvickers.com/). It was designed and built by Josh Carpenter of Mozilla in collaboration with [Mr.doob](http://twitter.com/mrdoob) of three.js. Cinema 4D was used to first design the look and feel of the world, and then models, textures and camera paths were imported into a three.js scene programmed by doob.</p>
