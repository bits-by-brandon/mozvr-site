intro: A panorama viewer made from equirectangular images mapped to a WebGL sphere that surrounds the user.

<p class="intro h2">Panorama Viewer is a simple visualization of panoramic photos mapped onto a WebGL sphere, allowing us to step into environments ranging from a mountain range in France to the heart of the Louvre. The source photos are not stereoscopic, so the scenes lack a true sense of depth (the eyes instead perceiving every point as being the same distance, from a rock at our feet to the horizon many kilometers away), but regardless it is fundamentally satisfying to "step into" stunning high resolution photos, which have been sourced from Creative Commons-licensed photos on Flickr's excellent [Equirectangular pool](https://www.flickr.com/groups/equirectangular/).</p>
