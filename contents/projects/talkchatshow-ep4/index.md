<p class="intro h2">Talk Chat Show Thing is [eleVR](http://elevr.com/)'s show about VR, filmed in VR. In this episode they chat with Josh and Diego from the Mozilla VR team about the future of virtual reality on the open web. The footage was recorded in stereoscopic 360Â° video at dawn from the roof of Mozilla San Francisco, using an array of GoPro cameras and a mounting rig from [360Heros](http://shop.360heros.com/category-s/1817.htm). It is viewable without plugins or installs in the browser thanks to eleVR's open source WebGL [VR Web Player](https://github.com/hawksley/eleVR-Web-Player) which loads a source MP4 file with equirectangular over-under formatting.</p>
