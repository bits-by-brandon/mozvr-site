intro: Manipulating a photo collage with motion control using the Leap Motion and Leap JavaScript SDK.
---

<p class="intro h2">The Leap Motion Collage demo enables users to sort photos in virtual reality using motion control gestures and the Leap Motion controller. Built by Leap's [Peter Ehrlich](http://www.twitter.com/ehrlicp), it leverages the [LeapJS JavaScript SDK](https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/javascript/index.html), which empowers web developers to communicate with the Leap Motion API. Source for this and other sample projects is available on the [Leap Developer Portal](https://developer.leapmotion.com/).</p>
