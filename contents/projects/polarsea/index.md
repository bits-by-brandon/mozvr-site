<p class="intro h2">The Polar Sea is a journey into the arctic Northwest Passage as climate change melts ancient ice. Created by [DEEP](http://www.deep-360.com/) in association with [ARTE](http://future.arte.tv/fr/polarsea360), it includes a 360° interactive documentary experience for web and mobile, which takes users into 360° video scenes shot from helicopters, boats, and drones. Using [eleVR](http://elevr.com/)'s open source WebGL [Web Player](https://github.com/hawksley/eleVR-Web-Player), we present the trailer for Polar Sea in web VR, playing in the browser from an equirectangular MP4 without plugins or installs.</p>
