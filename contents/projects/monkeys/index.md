<p class="intro h2">The web at it's best is wild, weird and creative. Monkeys by <a href="https://twitter.com/vihartvihart" target="_blank">Vi Hart</a> of <a href="http://elevr.com/" target="_blank">eleVR</a> is a surreal example of that ethos, placing us inside a seamless sequence of colorful primates. The result is whimsical and strange, but also an interesting exploration of the use of space in virtual reality. There are no flat planes here!</p>
