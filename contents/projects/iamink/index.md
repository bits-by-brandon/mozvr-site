intro: An animated short in which a drawing comes to life and draws its own life.
---

<p class="intro h2">A drawing comes to life and draws its own life, in this animated short from Nicky Case. "For the longest time, I avoided experimenting with VR, because I only knew how to animate in 2D, not 3D. But one day, I discovered a compromise: 2.5D. I Am Ink was first animated in [Adobe Flash CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html), then exported to HTML5 using [CreateJS](http://createjs.com). I then wrote a piece of Javascript to convert the CreateJS data/code into a 2.5D world in [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/), which was then rendered into VR using smus's [Responsive WebVR](http://smus.com/responsive-vr/). Note that this workflow was also all automated - allowing me to quickly iterate on the animation in Flash, and immediately produce a beautiful 2.5D VR animation."
